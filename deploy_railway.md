# Railway Deployment Guide

Since Render is having persistent Python 3.13 compatibility issues, Railway is a better alternative with better Python version control and Docker support.

## Steps to Deploy on Railway:

1. **Go to Railway**: Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up/login

2. **Connect GitHub**: 
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select the `100gates` repository

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Go to the "Variables" tab
   - Add these environment variables:
     ```
     TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7565894498:AAE35txlRa2uTbZ7lBJWvrM9ExAtGYRtfuI
     WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app
     SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
     QUESTION_TIMEOUT=30
     TOTAL_GATES=100
     PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE=69
     ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS=your-telegram-id
     ```

4. **Add PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Go to "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

5. **Deploy**:
   - Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and deploy
   - The app will be available at your Railway URL

## Why Railway is Better:

- **Better Python version control**: Can specify exact Python versions
- **Docker support**: Full Docker containerization
- **More reliable**: Less issues with package compatibility
- **Better debugging**: More detailed logs and error messages
- **Free tier**: Generous free tier for development

## Current Configuration:

The project is already configured for Railway with:
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Docker container setup
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- All necessary environment variables

Railway will automatically use Python 3.11 as specified in the Dockerfile, avoiding all the Python 3.13 compatibility issues we've been experiencing with Render.
